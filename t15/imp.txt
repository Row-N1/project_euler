This one really didn't go well, but I left my through process in at all stages and I think it's good
to show. It's very annoying that you can actually use binomial 40 C 20, and I got agonisingly close
to re-discovering the formula (I literally did 2n! / n ^ 2), but the brute force pascal triangle
worked too.
There were definitely some silly errors while working on this but I also think I had some good ideas,
though this one really left me feeling like I should've gotten it sooner. Perhaps I need to go even
further back and revise the maths at the core of this problem. It just didn't compute to me that
you could 'choose' 20 options out of 40, implicitly doing the other 20 the other way. I also don't 
recall binomial being about permutations instead of combinations but perhaps that the nCr nPr manual
addition to the formula.
I did my best to be mathematical and elegant. Oh well
